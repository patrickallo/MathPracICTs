\section{Introduction}


\begin{frame}

\frametitle{Introduction}

\begin{itemize}
    
	\item \textsl{Background:} Philosophy of mathematical practice, with special attention to social and interactive aspects.

	\item \textsl{Focus:} Collaboration between mathematicians, with special attention to massive collaboration where ICTs play a central role.
	
	\item \textsl{Goal:} Show that logical models that are inspired by the interactive and dynamic turn in logic can be used to classify different types of collaboration.
	
	\item \textsl{Approach:} General model, a case-study (and probably a second).
	
	\item \textsl{Paper:} ``Mathematical arguments and distributed knowledge'', in: A. Aberdein \& I. Dove (eds), The Argument of Mathematics, Springer, 2013: 339--60.
\end{itemize}

\section{Three models of epistemic communities}

\begin{frame}

\frametitle{Three models of epistemic communities}

\begin{block}{``Economic'' model (signalling games, \emph{etc.})}
\begin{itemize}
 
	\item Most common formal representation of epistemic communities.
 	\item Communities are represented as graphs, with agents as nodes, and communication-channels as directed edges.
	\item Communication is qualified in terms of \emph{cost}, \emph{payoff}, and \emph{reliability}.
	\item \textsl{Main question:} What is the optimal organisation? {\scriptsize(e.g.\ directed circle, periphery sponsored star, centered sponsored star, \emph{etc.})}
 
\end{itemize}
\end{block}

\end{frame}



\begin{frame}

\frametitle{Three models of epistemic communities (II)}

\begin{block}{Abstract argumentation}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Focus on arguments rather than agents.
	\item Argumentation-networks are graphs with individual arguments as nodes, and attacks as directed edges.
	\item \textsl{Main question:} What is the ``winning'' argument?
	\item Basic system isn't very flexible, but \emph{meta-argumentation} can be used to model agents and other sources of information, and also closes the gap between abstract argumentation and Toulmin's argumentative model.
\end{itemize}

\end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}

\frametitle{Three models of epistemic communities (III)}

\begin{block}{Logical models}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Focus on
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item what individual agents know and believe,
			\item how knowledge and belief is distributed, and
			\item how this distribution can change over time.
		\end{enumerate}
	\item Higher-order knowledge (knowing what others know) is crucial.
	\item Group-knowledge can be more or less distributed, and more or less transparent to the different members.
	\item Logical distinctions between types of communication further refine the distinctions available in graph-based models.
\end{itemize}
\end{block}
\end{frame}



\section{Case Study: The Polymath Project(s)}


\begin{frame}

\frametitle{Case Study: The Polymath Project(s)}
\begin{quote}
	I'm interested in the question of whether it is possible for lots of people to solve one single problem rather than lots of people solve one problem each. (Gowers 2009)
\end{quote}
\begin{block}{Background}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textsl{Central figures:} Timothy Gowers, Michael Nielsen, and Terence Tao.
    \item \textsl{Aim:} Massive collaboration in proof-search.
	\item \textsl{First problem:} Elementary proof of the Density Hales-Jewett Theorem.
	\item \textsl{Status:} 8 Polymath projects (2 solved), and 4 mini-polymaths (3 solved).
\end{itemize}
\end{block}
\end{frame} 

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Polymath (II)}
\begin{block}{Main Features}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Specificity of combinatorial problems.
		\item Lakatos visualised.
		\item Contributions include analogies, reformulations of the problem, proofs of simpler related problems.
		\item Different members play different roles.
		\item Professional and amateur mathematicians.
		%\item Room for ``crazy'' suggestions.
	\end{itemize}
\end{block}
\begin{block}{Implementation}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Collaboration on a blog.
		\item Central figures can submit posts, other contributors can comment.
		\item Posts of central figures can both express own ideas, and summarise input from comments.
	\end{itemize}
\end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}

\frametitle{Polymath (III)}

\begin{block}{Fact about star-models}
  Both types of star-models are the only optimal models whenever there is a chance that information may degrade when repeatedly transmitted {\scriptsize(i.e.\ when the social ``distance'' matters)}.
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Conjecture about the Polymath organisation}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textsl{Assumption:} Distorted communication is more likely in heterogeneous communities.
		\item Because comments are visible to all, Polymath does not function as a pure star-model.
		\item Summaries of comments in posts mimic the communication in a (centered sponsored) star-model.
		\item Because the Polymath community is very diverse, the star-model can be assumed to be optimal.
		\item ``Styles of communication'' cannot be distinguished.
	\end{itemize}
\end{block}

\end{frame}

\section{Modelling shared and higher-order knowledge}

\begin{frame}

\frametitle{Basics of multi-agent epistemic knowledge}

\begin{block}{Individual knowledge}
\begin{itemize} 
	\item Language to talk about what individual agents know.
	\item Analysis of individual knowledge in terms of \emph{exclusion} of alternatives to the actual world.
	\item Can be used to describe knowledge and ignorance of what is the case, \ldots
\end{itemize}
\end{block}
\begin{block}{Higher-order and shared knowledge}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \ldots but also knowledge and ignorance of knowledge and ignorance of others.
	\item Additional language to talk about different types of group-knowledge, which allows one to talk about how knowledge is distributed, and the knowledge and ignorance of that distribution.
\end{itemize}
\end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Types of Group-Knowledge (I)}
	\begin{block}{Distributed Knowledge}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item $\phi$ is $\D$-known in a group $\mathcal{G}$ iff:
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Every non-$\phi$ world is excluded by some member of $\mathcal{G}$.
					\item $\phi$ can be deduced by combining the knowledge of all members of $\mathcal{G}$.
				\end{itemize}
			\item $\D$-knowledge is deductively closed and fully introspective (\textbf{S5}-knowledge).
			\item What is merely $\D$-known is only implicitly known.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{block}
	
	\begin{block}{Individual Knowledge}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item $\phi$ is $\So$-known in $\mathcal{G}$ iff some member of $\mathcal{G}$ knows $\phi$.
			\item $\So$-knowledge is not deductively closed.
			\item What is merely $\So$-known is explicitly known because:
				\begin{itemize}
					\item It is not deductively closed.
					\item It can be communicated by some agent.
				\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}
	\end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Types of Group-Knowledge (II)}
	\begin{block}{General Knowledge}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item $\phi$ is $\E$-known in $\mathcal{G}$ iff all members of $\mathcal{G}$ know $\phi$.
			\item $\E$-knowledge is deductively closed, but is not fully introspective.
			\item What is $\E$-known is explicitly known because:
				\begin{itemize}
					\item It is also $\So$-known.
					\item It can be communicated by all agents.
				\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}
	\end{block}
	
	\begin{block}{Common Knowledge}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item $\phi$ is $\E$-known in $\mathcal{G}$ iff:
				\begin{itemize}
					\item $\E^1 \phi \leftrightarrow \E \phi$ and
					$\E^{k+1} \leftrightarrow \E\E^k \phi$.
					\item $\phi$ is $\E^k$-known for all finite $k$
				\end{itemize}
			\item $\C$-knowledge is deductively closed and fully introspective (\textbf{S5}-knowledge).
		\end{itemize}
	\end{block}
	
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Styles of communication}
\begin{block}{Two facts about common knowledge}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item No agreement / coordinated action without common knowledge.
		\item Common knowledge cannot be achieved through unreliable communication (no certainty of message being received).
	\end{itemize}
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Public and private announcements}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item All and only public announcements give rise to common knowledge.
		\item Private announcements are announcements where there is uncertainty about what is being announced.
	\end{itemize}
\end{block}
\end{frame}


\section{Modelling collaborative mathematics}

\begin{frame}

\frametitle{A few setups}

\begin{block}{The inference network}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Division of labour by distributing computational effort.
		\item Making implicitly available knowledge explicit.
		\item No need for public announcements.
		\item Protocols often rely on presence of \emph{wise man}.
	\end{itemize}
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Solving predefined subtasks}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Solving big problem by splitting it up in subtasks, and assigning these to different subgroups.
		\item Common knowledge can be restricted to subgroups and/or to certain bodies of knowledge.
		\item Subgroups can treat other subgroups as individual agents, and thus ignore actual distribution of knowledge in other groups.
	\end{itemize}
\end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Coordination and diversity in Polymath (I)}
\begin{block}{Core features}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textsl{Question:} What is the epistemic status of the ``publicly available'' information on the Polymath blog?
		\item \textsl{First feature:} It is common knowledge that it is publicly available.
		\item \textsl{Second feature:} Even if \emph{all} the publicly available information is generally known, this fact isn't common knowledge.
		\item \textsl{Simplifying assumption:} Unlike the comments, the posts (i.e.\ contributions by central figures) can be treated as if they were common knowledge.
	\end{itemize}
\end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Coordination and diversity in Polymath (II)}

\begin{block}{Some requirements}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Not every set of agents is a group we can talk about.
	\item All agents can make announcements, but only some of them can make \emph{public announcements}.
\end{itemize}
\end{block}


\begin{block}{Communication-styles in Polymath}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Private announcements play no role of significance.
	\item \emph{General announcements} are the rule, and are crucial to the diversity of the community.
	\item Public announcements are the prerogative of the central figures, and can be used to set and revise the agenda, and to promote or demote the input from the periphery.
\end{itemize}
\end{block}

\end{frame}


\section{Case Study: HoTT}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Case Study: HoTT (I)}
\begin{quote}
	preliminary ideas, work under construction
\end{quote}
\begin{block}{Background}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textsl{Central figures:} About two dozen mathematicians affiliated to IAS, among whom Peter Aczel, Andrei Bauer and Mike Shulman.
    \item \textsl{Aim:} To write and freely share, in ``informal mathematical English'', a book on Homotopy Type Theory as an alternative foundation to set theory.
	\item \textsl{Status:} Book has recently been finished (writing took six months only, discussion phase before that).
\end{itemize}
\end{block}
\end{frame} 





\begin{frame}
\frametitle{HoTT (II)}

\begin{block}{Main features}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Non-formal yet formalizable.
   \item Different members on a par.
   \item Professional mathematicians only.
\end{itemize}
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Implementation}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Unix-based version control system Git.
   \item Contains possibility of parallel histories.
   \item Portions of text can be branched and merged.
   \item Set up: stand alone, web application, GitHub.
   \item Latter: combines Git with social network.
   \item Functions as archive and planning device.
\end{itemize}
\end{block}


\end{frame} 



\begin{frame}
\frametitle {HoTT (III)}

\begin{block}{Some initial insights}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Mere distinctions between public, general and private announcements are not enough.
	\item We need to model the functioning of Git, which includes \emph{branching} and \emph{merging} of branches.
	\item Dynamic doxastic logics supplemented with a means to duplicate agents provide the basis for this.
	\item Further requirements: a way to model agents \emph{and} the content they modify, a method for tracking history, \ldots
\end{itemize}
\end{block}

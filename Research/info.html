<p>The HoTT book</p>

<p>The HoTT book is finished!</p>

<p>Since spring, and even before that, I have participated in a great collaborative effort on writing a book on Homotopy Type Theory. It is finally finished and ready for public consumption. You can get the book freely at http://homotopytypetheory.org/book/. <a href="Research/Blog-postMikeShulman.html">Mike Shulman has written about the contents of the book</a>, so I am not going to repeat that here. Instead, I would like to comment on the socio-technological aspects of making the book, and in particular about what we learned from open-source community about collaborative research.</p>


<p>We are a group of two dozen mathematicians who wrote a 600 page book in less than half a year. This is quite amazing, since mathematicians do not normally work together in large groups. In a small group they can get away with using obsolete technology, such as sending each other source LaTeX files by email, but with two dozen people even Dropbox or any other file synchronization system would have failed miserably. Luckily, many of us are computer scientists disguised as mathematicians, so we knew how to tackle the logistics. We used git and github.com. In the beginning it took some convincing and getting used to, although it was not too bad. In the end the repository served not only as an archive for our files, but also as a central hub for planning and discussions. For several months I checked github more often than email and Facbook. Github was my Facebook (without the cute kittens). If you do not know about tools like git but you write scientific papers (or you create any kind of digital content) you really, really should learn about revision control systems. Even as a sole author of a paper you will profit from learning how to use one, not to mention that you can make <a href="http://vimeo.com/68761218"  >pretty videos</a> of how you wrote your paper.</p>

<p>But more importantly, the spirit of collaboration that pervaded our group at the Institute for Advanced Study was truly amazing. We did not fragment. We talked, shared ideas, explained things to each other, and completely forgot who did what (so much in fact that we had to put some effort into reconstruction of history lest it be forgotten forever). The result was a substantial increase in productivity. There is a lesson to be learned here (other than the fact that the Institute for Advanced Study is the world&#x2019;s premier research institution), namely that mathematicians benefit from being a little less possessive about their ideas and results. I know, I know, academic careers depend on proper credit being given and so on, but really those are just the idiosyncrasies of our time. If we can get mathematicians to share half-baked ideas, not to worry who contributed what to a paper, or even who the authors are, then we will reach a new and unimagined level of productivity. Progress is made by those who dear the break rules.</p>

<p>Truly open research habitats cannot be obstructed by copyright, profit-grabbing publishers, patents, commercial secrets, and funding schemes that are based on faulty achievement metrics. Unfortunately we are all caught up in a system which suffers from all of these evils. But we made a small step in the right direction by making the book source code freely available under a permissive Creative Commons license. Anyone can take the book and modify it, send us improvements and corrections, translate it, or even sell it without giving us any money. (If you twitched a little bit when you read that sentence then the system has gotten to you.)</p>

<p>We decided not to publish the book with an academic publisher at present because we wanted to make it available to everyone fast and at no cost. The book can be freely downloaded, as well as bought cheaply in hardcover and paperback versions from lulu.com. (When was the last time you paid under $30 for a 600 page hardcover academic monograph?) Again, I can feel some people thinking &#x201c;oh but a real academic publisher bestows quality&#x201d;. This sort of thinking is reminiscent of Wikipedia vs. Britannica arguments, and we all know how that story ended. Yes, good quality of research must be ensured. But once we accept the fact that anyone can publish anything on the Internet for the whole world to see, and make a cheap professionally looking book out of it, we quickly realize that censure is not effective anymore. Instead we need a decentralized system of endorsments which cannot be manipulated by special interest groups. Things are moving in this direction with the recently established Selected Papers Network and similar efforts. I hope these will catch on.</p>

<p>However, there is something else we can do. It is more radical, but also more useful. Rather than letting people only evaluate papers, why not give them a chance to participate and improve them as well? Put all your papers on github and let others discuss them, open issues, fork them, improve them, and send you corrections. Does it sound crazy? Of course it does, open source also sounded crazy when Richard Stallman announced his manifesto. Let us be honest, who is going to steal your LaTeX source code? There are much more valuable things to be stolen. If you are tenured professor you can afford to lead the way. Have your grad student teach you git and put your stuff somewhere publicly. Do not be afraid, they tenured you to do such things.</p>

<p>So we are inviting everyone to help us improve the book by participating on github. You can leave comments, point out errors, or even better, make corrections yourself! We are not going to worry who you are, how much you are contributing, and who shall take credit. The only thing that matters is whether your contributions are any good.</p>

<p>My last observation is about formalization of mathematics. Mathematicians like to imagine that their papers could in principle be formalized in set theory. This gives them a feeling of security, not unlike the one experienced by a devout man entering a venerable cathedral. It is a form of faith professed by logicians. Homotopy Type Theory is an alternative foundation to set theory. We too claim that ordinary mathematics can in principle be formalized in homotopy type theory. But guess what, you do not have to take our word for it! We have formalized the hardest parts of the HoTT book and verified the proofs with computer proof assistants. Not once but twice. And we formalized first, then we wrote the book because it was easier to formalize. We win on all counts (if there is a race).</p>

<p>I hope you like the book, it contains an amazing amount of new mathematics.</p>

<p>Just wanted to say: all of those who worked on this deserve medals or whatever your favourite form of showing-appreciation-from-the-general-public is, because not only this is really exciting material, but it was all performed openly (git!) and published for free! I hope this will set an example for future researchers as how-things-should-be-done. I&#x2019;m so happy about this I will probably order a hardcover, haha.</p>

<p>Congratulations and thank you!</p>

<p>Really appreciate the way you all went.</p>

<p>There is a circle of more or less active Linux kernel developers in Germany, meeting every year or two in a relaxed manner. The basic statement of the last meetings, althoug some of us still are contributing strongly, was that Linux kernel development is not the key any more. The motivation to develop something new, to establish a non commercial alternative concept to Microsoft, Apple and whoever UNIX supplier is not longer the catching point.</p>

<p>The Linux concept is mainstream and the Open Source idea is now adopted and driven even by the commercial key players in this segment.</p>

<p>One common sense raised in the these days more socialy focused meetings in the last two years &#x2013; that after software development understood the &#x201c;good&#x201d; in being open, now content &#x2013; any content &#x2013; raises the public issues. Monopolies on information and data &#x2013; like the peer review process organized by the publishers in science, like the MP3 avoidance strategy of many labels, like the decreasing number of companies that own rights on electronic maps &#x2013; are the boiling point of our discussions these days and alternatives like open street map, creative commoms licenses for music and I really appreciate the excample you provide by publishing and researching in a kind of &#x201c;swarm inteligence&#x201d;.</p>

<p>dear andrej, congratulations to all of you on this book. i think it&#x2019;s wonderful that you have collaborated in this way, and am also very positive about the open source approach in the publishing. let&#x2019;s hope that this type of collaboration spreads, replacing the `idiosyncrasies&#x2019; that you mention. best wishes, frank</p>

<p>Homotopy Type Theory: Univalent Foundations of Mathematics</p>
<p>The Univalent Foundations Program, Institute for Advanced Study</p>

<p>The book is the result of an amazing collaboration between virtually everyone involved in the Univalent Foundations Program at the IAS last year.  It contains the state of the art in HoTT as an informal foundation of mathematics, and that requires a bit of explanation.</p>

<p>As readers of this site know, HoTT can be every bit as formal as anyone would like (and more), right down to machine-checkable proofs in Coq and Agda.  But even paper and pencil type theory can be a challenge to understand for the uninitiated &#x2014; thus the project (proposed by Peter Aczel) of developing some conventions and notation for &#x201c;informal type theory&#x201d;. Once the working group at IAS formed, things quickly snowballed from settling on terminology and notation (always a source of healthy dispute!), sample exposition, to writing up some new results in the informal style, and finally an outline of chapters and assignments of authors for first drafts.</p>

<p>Writing a 500 pp. book on an entirely new subject, with 40 authors, in 9 months is already an amazing achievement.  (Andrej Bauer has written a blog post on the sociology of writing the book here &#x2014; with animation!)  But even more astonishing, in my humble opinion, is the mathematical and logical content: this is an entirely new foundation, starting from scratch and reaching to , the Yoneda lemma, the cumulative hierarchy of sets, and a new constructive treatment of the real numbers &#x2014; with a whole lot of new and fascinating mathematics and logic along the way. (Mike Shulman has written a blog post with a more detailed outline here.)</p>

<p>But for all that, what is perhaps most remarkable about the book is what is not in it: formalized mathematics.  One of the novel things about HoTT is that it is not just formal logical foundations of mathematics in principle: it really is code that runs in a computer proof assistant.  This book is an exercise in &#x201c;unformalization&#x201d; of results that were, for the most part, first developed in a formalized setting.  (Many of the files are available on GitHub and through the Code section of this site.)  At the risk of sounding a bit grandiose, this represents something of a &#x201c;new paradigm&#x201d; for mathematics:  fully formal proofs that can be run on the computer to ensure their absolute rigor, accompanied by informal exposition that can focus more on the intuition and examples.  Our goal in this Book has been to provide a first, extended example of this new style of doing mathematics, by developing the latter, informal aspect to the point where &#x2014; hopefully &#x2014;others can see how it works and join us in pushing it forward.</p>

<p>Many of you have heard murmurings about this book for several months now. I&#x2019;m happy to report that it&#x2019;s now out!</p>

<p>Homotopy type theory: univalent foundations of mathematics, by the Univalent Foundations Program.</p>
<p>At the link you can download electronic versions for screen, ereader, or printer, and order paperback and hardback bound copies at cost from lulu.com. The book is CC BY-SA licensed, which in particular means it will always be freely available.</p>


<p>So where did this book come from? As it says in the preface, we did not set out to write a book. It all began last fall when Peter Aczel proposed to start a working group on informal type theory. I&#x2019;ve mentioned this idea before: the point is that type theory is usually a very formalized system (even to the point of being implemented in computer proof assistants), whereas mathematicians are accustomed to speak instead in informal &#x201c;mathematical English&#x201d; (or French, Russian, etc.). The usual implicit assumption is that mathematical English could be formalized in a set-theoretic foundation such as ZFC, and this requires various conventions on what we can and can&#x2019;t say in mathematical English. The goal of informal type theory is to develop conventions for a version of mathematical English whose &#x201c;implicit underlying foundation&#x201d; is instead type theory &#x2014; specifically, homotopy type theory.</p>

<p>The informal type theory working group met a few times and had some good arguments, but after a while we realized we needed something to focus our discussions. So we began a project of writing down some of our recent results in homotopy type theory in informal mathematical English, and to give the project some coherence (and an incentive to settle on uniform conventions) we thought of what we were writing as chapters in a book. Eventually we noticed that an actual book was starting to take shape, and that such a book could be extremely valuable, both as a &#x201c;report&#x201d; on the progress of the special year, and as an introduction for newcomers to the field not requiring them to know or learn any formalized type theory. Hence, the HoTT Book.</p>

<p>Due to its origins, some of the material in the book has already been published elsewhere, while some of it was &#x201c;common knowledge&#x201d; in the HoTT community before the IAS program but may not have been written down anywhere (except perhaps in a computer proof assistant). On the other hand, a good amount of the material is new, and may yet be published elsewhere by the people responsible for it (or, in a couple of cases, was published elsewhere during the writing of the book). Making the latter possible is one reason we chose a permissive license.</p>

<p>I want to emphasize that the book is specifically intended to be readable by mathematicians who do not know any type theory, any computer science &#x2014; or even any homotopy theory! If you are reading this blog, chances are you are in the intended audience. So you should go have a look!</p>

<p>That said, type theory can be very difficult to explain to a mathematical audience. We did our best to give a &#x201c;working mathematician&#x2019;s&#x201d; introduction to type theory in the first couple of chapters of the book, but I am certain that for many readers, it will still be confusing. We want your feedback! We will be releasing &#x201c;bug fix&#x201d; enhancements on a rolling basis based on reader feedback, and eventually there may be an official Second Edition. Tell us what is confusing, where you got lost, where there are typos, where the math is just wrong, etc. etc. We&#x2019;d prefer if you open a github issue on the book project, but it&#x2019;s also fine to just put a comment on the HoTT blog. And of course we&#x2019;re very happy to discuss what&#x2019;s in the book as well.</p>

<p>To whet your appetite, I will end this post with an annotated table of contents of the book.</p>

<p><u>Type theory.</u> This chapter is a brief introduction to dependent type theory without any homotopical features. It begins with an overview of how type theory differs from set theory as a foundation for mathematics (influenced by discussions such as this and this), and then introduces concepts like type universes, dependent types (which in the book we call type families), &#x3bb;-abstraction, induction and recursion, and propositions-as-types. It also establishes notation and conventions for the rest of the book.</p>

<p><u>Homotopy type theory.</u> This chapter introduces the homotopical viewpoint on type theory, where &#x201c;proofs of equality&#x201d; are regarded as paths in a space or equivalences in an &#x221e;-groupoid. It also adds to type theory the function extensionality and univalence axioms &#x2014; of which the latter, due to Voevodsky, is one of the main innovations of homotopy type theory. Finally, it explains how to &#x201c;compute&#x201d; with paths in various kinds of types, and proves that many types have universal properties.</p>

<p><u>Sets and logic.</u> This chapter begins by defining a class of types called sets, which have no &#x201c;higher homotopy&#x201d; and hence behave basically like the sets in a (structural) set theory such as ETCS. Then it discusses various aspects of logic in homotopy type theory, introducing &#x201c;mere propositions&#x201d; ((&#x2212;1)-truncated types) and the corresponding propositional truncation, and statements of the law of excluded middle, the axiom of choice, and the propositional resizing axiom (none of which we need to use very much in the rest of the book).</p>

<p><u>Equivalences.</u> This chapter studies several equivalent ways to define the notion of &#x201c;equivalence of types&#x201d; in a well-behaved way. It also proves some useful general facts about equivalences, and that the univalence axiom implies the function extensionality axiom.</p>
<u>
<p>Induction.</u> This chapter adds to our type theory the general notion of inductive type, which includes most of the type forming operations from chapter 1 as special cases. It proves (by a sufficiently general example, namely Martin-L&#xf6;f&#x2019;s W-types) that inductive types can equivalently be characterized as homotopy-initial algebras for polynomial endofunctors, and describes briefly several generalizations of inductive types such as inductive families, inductive-inductive types, and inductive-recursive types.</p>

<p><u>Higher inductive types.</u> Next to univalence, HITs are the most important new aspect of homotopy type theory, allowing us to construct higher-dimensional &#x201c;spaces&#x201d; such as spheres and tori; perform homotopical constructions such as suspensions, truncations, localizations, and homotopy colimits; and generate free algebraic structures of all sorts. This chapter introduces them by way of many examples.</p>

<p><u>Homotopy n-types.</u> This chapter studies the general notion of n-type, which includes sets (0-types), mere propositions ((&#x2212;1)-types), and contractible types ((&#x2212;2)-types) as special cases. It defines the n-truncation operation using higher inductive types, and constructs the (n-connected, n-truncated) orthogonal factorization system on types. It ends with a brief discussion of more general &#x201c;modalities&#x201d;.</p>

<p><u>Homotopy theory.</u> Here we finally start to get the payoff. Combining higher inductive types with univalence, we calculate &#x3c0;1(S1), &#x3c0;n(Sn), and &#x3c0;3(S2), construct long exact sequences and the Hopf fibration, and prove the Freudenthal suspension theorem and the van Kampen theorem. We also prove that Whitehead&#x2019;s theorem holds for n-types for any finite n, and observe that its general form can be regarded as a foundational axiom (&#x201c;Whitehead&#x2019;s principle&#x201d;) akin to excluded middle or choice. This chapter incorporates a lot of new work that was done this past winter and spring.</p>

<p><u>Category theory.</u> I blogged about the contents of this chapter already. The basic idea is that if we define &#x201c;categories&#x201d; appropriately, requiring them to satisfy a &#x201c;local&#x201d; version of the univalence axiom, then all proofs and constructions will automatically be invariant under isomorphism of objects in a category and under equivalence of categories. In particular, equivalent categories become equal.</p>

<p><u>Set theory.</u> This chapter begins by proving that the &#x201c;sets&#x201d; (as defined in chapter 3) do in fact satisfy the axioms of ETCS (or a constructive version thereof, depending on whether we assume excluded middle and choice). Then it studies a few topics from traditional &#x201c;set theory&#x201d;, such as cardinal and ordinal numbers, finding that they behave mostly like their classical versions, but are slightly improved by univalence. Finally, it constructs a model of ZF-style set theory inside homotopy type theory, using a higher inductive type to model the cumulative hierarchy.</p>

<p><u>Real numbers.</u> This chapter explores two definitions of the real numbers. First there are the Dedekind reals, which behave just as expected (modulo issues of constructivity and predicativity). Then there are the Cauchy reals, for which we can use a higher inductive-inductive type to improve on the usual constructive treatment. If we assume excluded middle, then both definitions agree and behave like the real numbers we are all familiar with. It ends by sketching another higher inductive-inductive definition: Conway&#x2019;s surreal numbers.</p>

<p>For more blogging about the HoTT Book, see the official announcement post by Steve Awodey, which discusses the paradigm of &#x201c;unformalization&#x201d;, and this post by Andrej Bauer, which discusses the socio-technological aspects of writing the book (which was a new and fascinating experience).</p>

<p>Homotopy Type Theory: the book is out!</p>
<p>The long-awaited book on Homotopy Type Theory, a creation of a group of mathematicians working under the collective name of Univalent Foundations Program, is now out! (See here for a snapshot at the content.) And there are many reasons to rejoice:</p>
<p>I&#x2019;ve been following with much interest the development of the program, which presents itself as an alternative to set theory for the foundations of mathematics. I don&#x2019;t expect to understand more than 5% of the mathematical content of the book, but I hope to at least be able to understand the core ideas and have a feel for how they are put in practice.</p>
<p>It is a fantastic illustration of the power of collective, distributed work in mathematics, which is by and large a discipline still based (at least in theory, if not in practice) on the &#x2018;lone thinker&#x2019; model. The book was written in only six months, which would be unthinkable for a single author or even for a small number of co-authors (according to A. Bauer, two dozen mathematicians were involved in the writing process).</p>
<p>It is entirely and completely open access. What&#x2019;s more, through the github platform used also in the writing process (which I am myself not familiar with), readers can actively contribute to the content of the book, propose modifications, improvements etc. (Again, my source is Bauer's post.) </p>

<p>So this new book may rock not only the foundations of mathematics as such; it may also represent a revolution in how mathematics is practiced, a move towards a more collaborative model.</p>

<p>UPDATE: Eric Schliesser has a post at NewAPPS on the book, where he quotes this wonderful passage by Steve Awodey: </p>
<p>But for all that, what is perhaps most remarkable about the book is what is not in it: formalized mathematics. One of the novel things about HoTT is that it is not just formal logical foundations of mathematics in principle: it really is code that runs in a computer proof assistant. This book is an exercise in &#x201c;unformalization&#x201d; of results that were, for the most part, first developed in a formalized setting.

<p>The philosophical implications of this new approach are (potentially) phenomenal; I hope to be able to say more on the interplay between formalization/unformalization and intuitions in the near future, once I will have had the time to check the book more closely.</p>

<p>Github launched less than a year ago, but it&#x2019;s already making an impact on how open-source software is being created. Rails was there from day one, kick-starting the social software repository&#x2019;s traffic. It has taken off though it still doesn&#x2019;t compare to Sourceforge&#x2019;s traffic.</p>

<p>Github combines &#x201c;standard&#x201d; features of social networking sites with distributed source-control Git. You can follow or message a person, you can watch or fork projects and activity streams share your behaviors. Users are able to easily fork projects and create their own versions that can then be merged back to the original or take on a life of their own. Leaderboards help you find</p>

<p>There are 33 languages formally listed on github. The service is dominated by Ruby (36%) and Javascript (24%) with 31 other languages rounding out the rest.</p>

<p>Github has a free plan that lets you create your own public repositories, work on them with public collaborators and have 100MB of disk space. The rest of the plans up the disk space and provide the ability to have private repositories and collaborators. The more you pay the more ACLs you get. It&#x2019;s a great example of launching with a business model from the get-go. The appeal for a company is easy to see. Why manage their own source control? Especially if they will ever be open-sourcing any of the code.</p>

<p>One way to really see the impact of github is on Rails. When the project began it was just DHH contributing. Slowly it grew to include the core team, but when it moved to Github there was a boom. At the 5:05 mark there is almost an explosion of new committers. This will only increase with Rails 3 and the merger with merb (which is on github along with an oft-forked merb book).</p>
